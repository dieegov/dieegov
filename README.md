  I have been working with Web Development since I was 14 years old. In 2009 I built my first system called Gamenix, a game center that allowed the use of an unique account for all offered games. The first Project I have contributed to was called 2moons, an open-source clone of OGame, built-in PHP and MySQL. I was responsible for creating mods and hotfixes during the Project. 

  
  From there, I created my first game called “[Orbitwars](https://www.baixaki.com/download/orbitwars.htm)”. I spent several hours creating exclusive content and features to differentiate my game from private servers. It helped me learn more about web development, increasing my Javascript skills, Ajax implementation, CSS and JQuery.

  It was a small success, from which I raised enough money to buy my first Playstation 3.
  
  Orbitwars ended in 2012, gathering a record of 52 online players and more than 1000 accounts. 
  
  Nowadays, I’m a full stack developer, Bachelor of Information System by University of Santa Cecilia. This is my passion, and I am excited to see how far I can develop my skills.
